title: Making a Differential Drive Robot Simulator
---

#### A differential drive robot is a type of mobile robot with two, seperately motorized, wheels. We will discuss the motion model for a DDR and make a simple simulator that will help us interact with the motion model.

Motion models are mathematical models that describe the behavior of robots. There are two main types: kinematic models and dynamic models. Today we will be focusing on the former.
