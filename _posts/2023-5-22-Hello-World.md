title: Introduction to Poppy Humanoid using V-REP / CoppeliaSim
---

### The Poppy Project is an open-source platform that intertwines science, technology, art, and education. The Poppy Humanoid is the flagship model of the Poppy Project. Standing at 83 cm tall, the Poppy Humanoid is almost fully 3D printed and uses 25 motors to animate its body. These features make the Poppy Humanoid a cheaper alternative in the world of complex robotic systems. However, $10,000 is still far too much for (most) 21 year-old college students, so I decided to explore the Poppy Humanoid using V-REP, which is now Coppelia Sim.

#### Brief introduction of V-REP and Poppy: 
##### V-REP which is now known as Coppelia Sim is a powerful robotics simulator that allows you to import or create various robots, program them as you would in real life, and simulate them visually and numerically.
