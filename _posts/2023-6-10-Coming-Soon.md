In the middle of my junior fall semester. School is keeping my plenty busy but I am still working on various things behind the scenes.

OKR: Become proficient enough at C++ to kill a technical interview and get hired as an intern for the Summer

Key Results:
- KR1: Get through the C++ course before the next semester starts
- KR2: Complete an introductory project involving microcontrollers in C++
