Busy with Fall semester finals and applying to internships!

<!-- OKR: Land Summer internship

Key Results:
- KR1: Get through the C++ course before the next semester starts
- KR2: Add peripherals and functionality to my nixie tube clock build using C++ (Bonus points for using memory mapped registers on a microcontroller instead of using arduino)
- KR3: Do well in my courses -->
