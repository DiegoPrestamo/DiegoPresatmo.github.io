#### The Arduino Braccio is a customizable, Arduino-compatible robotic arm that replicates the functionality of a human arm with its shoulder, elbow, wrist, and a sophisticated gripper. This flexibility allows it to perform a wide array of tasks, from complex pre-programmed sequences to real-time responses based on sensory input, making it an engaging and educational tool. I have bought and built a Braccio and I want to run compter vision experiments with the gripper. This is headed in the direction of my ultimate goal of creating an intelliegent robot that can mimic human behavior.
