My name is Diego Prestamo. I am an incoming junior majoring in Electrical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science at Syracuse University. I have always been passionate about different fields of engineering, from quantum computing to aerospace, but nothing has spoken to me as much as robotics has. This blog is meant to document my projects which are currently at an introductory level. 

### More Information

My dream is to build a robot that learns by imitating humans.
